# chicage_wnv_statistical_testing
This project focuses on the EDA process and Statistical Testing to explore the prevalence of West Nile Virus in mosquitos in Chicago.

Part 1 contains all the data cleaning and EDA involved in this project, which helped gain insights into the problem space, ultimately informing which statistical tests were to be used in Part 2.

Part 2 includes Chi-squared independence testing, linear regression and logistic regression using the `statsmodels` library.
